# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather
forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the
user.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right
into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will
point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you
shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't
customize it when you are ready for it.

# Installing Webfonts

Follow these simple Steps.

## 1.

Put `cabinet-grotesk/` Folder into a Folder called `fonts/`.

## 2.

Put `cabinet-grotesk.css` into your `css/` Folder.

## 3. (Optional)

You may adapt the `url('path')` in `cabinet-grotesk.css` depends on your Website Filesystem.

## 4.

Import `cabinet-grotesk.css` at the top of you main Stylesheet.

```
@import url('cabinet-grotesk.css');
```

## 5.

```
font-family: 'CabinetGrotesk-Variable';
font-family: 'CabinetGrotesk-Thin';
font-family: 'CabinetGrotesk-Extralight';
font-family: 'CabinetGrotesk-Light';
font-family: 'CabinetGrotesk-Regular';
font-family: 'CabinetGrotesk-Medium';
font-family: 'CabinetGrotesk-Bold';

# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how
to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal
is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

## Postman Testing

## BACK END Configuration

This Project taught me the most out of any project thus far. Being inside multiple terminals, such as VM for Google
Cloud Services, the terminal for my main machine and last but not least the terminal for VS code. Having to run Node.js,
MongoDB, Celebrate , Nginx, PM2, Winston and Cors in these and make sure they are all on same versions then up to date
with each other and no errors or warnings.

Going through the process of VM was a process to and I also know that there is still much to learn looking how much
Google Cloud Services has inside of it. Seems we are just using 1/40th of the actual potential of it and that was a
process in and of itself. It makes me respect the how much there still is to learn and what I still can learn in the
future.

Backend seems more sensitive then frontend on settings and harder to find or navigate to, I think that is why it takes
longer to understand and I repsect back end configuration and still have lots to learn in the future and can see why it
takes years to learn the backend.

## TESTING

This whole project to me was a test, a test of the backend, the test of tying front to the back, the test if I can
follow instructions. A test if I could make the journey, a test of will, a test of will I not give up if things crash or
break! They did crash and break, but I kept trudging and pursued!
